## X-WHAT 

The x-WHAT model is a hydraulic solver for the flow-water problem in looped hydraulic networks. The model solves the conservation of mass and energy in hydraulic networks and allows the optimization of tanks considering pipeline costs, reservoir costs, and foundation costs by estimating lateral wind stresses at the surface of the reservoir, later translated to bending moment and shear forces at the foundation of the reservoir.

By merging hydraulics with structural design, the simple Excel-VBA tool can optimally design hydraulic network systems.
